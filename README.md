# Awesome Knowledge Infrastructure [![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge.svg)](https://awesome.re)

> A curated list of tools and practices for capturing, connecting, and operationalizing what your organization (and you) know.

**Knowledge infrastructure** is the connective tissue that lets people *and software* find, trust, and act on what an organization knows. It spans capturing knowledge (notes, docs, decisions), connecting it (links, graphs, catalogs), and operationalizing it (search, retrieval, AI assistants) — from a single engineer's note vault to an enterprise's internal developer portal and AI knowledge layer.

The pieces have always existed in scattered categories — wikis, docs tools, search, PKM apps. What's new is treating them as *one layer* worth designing on purpose. This list is an opinionated map of that layer.

Curated by [Taylor Dolezal](https://github.com/onlydole), drawing on years of work across open source and cloud native infrastructure. Contributions are welcome.
